## Summary
Our proposal to predict the survival rate of a Titanic passenger with given attributes was to analyze all data given from the Kaggle dataset for training 
(you can find it in the **Datasets** directory) to find out the most relevant variables to determine the likelihood of survival of a given passenger, 
after obtaining the most relevant variables, we developed several machine learning models to choose the three models with highest **accuracy** 
and **F1-Score**. 

We geatest problem that we encountered ...


**Problem type:** Classification

**Target class** Survival

**Objetive:** Predict with 80% Accuracy the survival rate.

**Hypothesis:** Being a female-child should be the main cause of survival.

## Selected models
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF kernel
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks (Tensorflow model) + SVM\
